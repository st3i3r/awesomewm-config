I'd like to tell you just a word
I am so sorry to disturb
You may be thinking I'm a fool

I heard you tell'em you don't care
I heard you thinking loud and clear
It doesn't make me proud of you

I know your time it's precious
But give me just a second
I need to straighten things out with you

You blew my hope and dreams away
And there is not a single day
I don't fear the worst because of you

And I know that it's not a dream
And I saw, yeah I saw your scheme
And I know you
I saw

I wonder if there's a justice
When I look right into your eyes
Those feelings never lie

My only weapon is this song
And you won't have to sing along
This is the story of my life

And I know that it's not a dream
And I saw, yeah I saw your scheme
And I know you
I saw

I know I know I know I know yes I know
I saw I saw I saw

I know that it's not a dream
I saw, yeah I saw your scheme
I know you
I know
