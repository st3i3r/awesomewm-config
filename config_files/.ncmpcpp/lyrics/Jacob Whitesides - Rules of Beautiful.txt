You're an angel, in disguise
When you color your eyes
But angels don't need covering

You're a princess, you're a queen
You don't need finer things
But I'll buy you diamond rings
Just because

'Cause you break the rules of beautiful
So stay with me for a minute or more
No need to fix what's beautiful
Oh you're beautiful

Like a flower all alone in a field of weeds
You don't need to change
You just need to be
The way you were made is just for me
You're beautiful
'Cause you break of the rules of beautiful

The rules as they are
Overlook your heart
But we've got history
That's deeper than these scars

Oh and I'll take it all
All your secrets and flaws
You'll make history by being
Who you are

'Cause you break the rules of beautiful
So stay with me for a minute or more
No need to fix what's beautiful
Oh you're beautiful

Like a flower all alone in a field of weeds
You don't need to change
You just need to be
The way you were made is just for me
You're beautiful
'Cause you break of the rules of beautiful

Oh you're beautiful
Oh you're beautiful
Oh you're beautiful

'Cause you break the rules of beautiful
So stay with me for a minute or more
No need to fix what's beautiful
Oh you're beautiful

Like a flower all alone in a field of weeds
You don't need to change
You just need to be
The way you were made is just for me
You're beautiful
You break of the rules of beautiful

If I rewrote the rules of beautiful
I would trace you on a page
And put it up
So the whole wide world could
Finally see what's beautiful
'Cause you break the rules of beautiful
