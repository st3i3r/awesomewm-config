[Verse-1]

From far away
In mountains deep
The night of blood
In twilight sleep
The armies force
For king and queen
There will be no
No victory

The swords collide
With power and force
As mighty men
Show no remorse
It is the time
The snow is melting
It is the time
Of reckoning


[Verse-2]

From far away
In mountains deep
The night of blood
In twilight sleep
Behind the light
For king and queen
There will be no
No victory

The swords collide
With power and force
As mighty men
Show no remorse
It is the time
The snow is melting
It is the time
Of reckoning
