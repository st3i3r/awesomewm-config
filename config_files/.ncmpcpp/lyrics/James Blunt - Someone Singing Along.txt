Somebody's gonna wave a flag
Somebody's going to attack
Somebody will tell you to pick a side
Tell you their version of wrong or right
Somebody's gonna let you in
Judged on the color of your skin
Slam a door in the face of your friend
Simply because you don't look like him
And then you gotta find a way that you're waking
Everybody's walking
You gotta find the words to say when you're talking
Everybody's talking

So I built the wars into a song
I'm hoping someone's singing along
And even if some notes are wrong
I'm hoping someone's singing along

'Cause just one voice is not enough
I need to hear from everyone
And even when I'm dead and gone
I'm hoping someone's singing along

Somebody's gonna build a wall
Then smash it with a cannon ball
Someone who somehow has got a gun
Will tell you who you can't and you can love
Some people keeping all the cash
They're gonna get away with that
Just 'cause some people don't think like me
Does that really make them the enemy?

And then you gotta find a way that you're waking
Everybody's walking
You gotta find the words to say when you're talking
Everybody's talking

So I built the wars into a song
I'm hoping someone's singing along
And even if some notes are wrong
I'm hoping someone's singing along

'Cause just one voice is not enough
I need to hear from everyone
And even when I'm dead and gone
I'm hoping someone's singing along

Make a noise, I can hear you now
Won't you raise your voice just a little louder
Make a noise, I can hear you now
Won't you raise your voice just a little louder

So I built the wars into a song
I'm hoping someone's singing along
And even if some notes are wrong
I'm hoping someone's singing along

'Cause just one voice is not enough
I need to hear from everyone
And even when I'm dead and gone
I'm hoping someone's singing along
