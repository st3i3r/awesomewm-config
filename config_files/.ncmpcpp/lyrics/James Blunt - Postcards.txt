Sundays sitting on your back porch
And I came on with a couple of chords
And I played for you.
You let me keep you entertained
With stories I exaggerate
That you know aren't true
And as you sit there making daisy chains
And I throw in a hand grenade
And tell you how it is I really feel for you.

I'm sending postcards from my heart.
Your love for a postmark and then,
You know that you make me feel like
We've been caught like kids in the schoolyard again.
And I can't keep it to myself
Can't spell it any better
L.O.V.E forever
I hope you know that
I'm sending a postcard
I don't care who sees what I've said
Or if the whole world knows what's in my head.

We chased the sun till it got away
On a bicycle that your daddy made
But not made for two
Then we sat out on your rocking chair
You with a flower in your hair
That I found for you
But then Monday always comes around
And it's sad 'cause I can't see you now
Want you to know you're always in my head

I'm sending postcards from my heart.
Your love for a postmark and then,
You know that you make me feel like
We've been caught like kids in the school yard again.
And I can't keep it to myself
Can't spell it any better
L.O.V.E forever
I hope you know that
I'm sending a postcard
I don't care who sees what I've said
Or if the whole world knows what's in my head.

You know sometimes its hard to see
You say the words that torture me
But inside I know exactly how I feel
The things that I can't say out loud
I'll find a place to write it down
I hope that they will find you in the end

I'm sending postcards from my heart.
Your love for a postmark and then,
You know that you make me feel like
We've been caught like kids in the school yard again.
And I can't keep it to myself
Can't spell it any better
L.O.V.E forever
I hope you know that
I'm sending a postcard
I don't care who sees what I've said
Or if the whole world knows what's in my head.

Know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know oh oh know oh oh know oh oh
All the things I want you to know.
